One of the two datasets to be used by the r code is too big to be uploaded to github. However, it can be downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00454/dataset.zip

For details of the dataset, please refer to the thesis of the producer of the dataset:
GUNGOR, ABDULMECIT, Benchmarking Authorship Attribution Techniques Using Over A Thousand Books by Fifty Victorian Era Novelists, Purdue Master of Thesis, 2018-04 

My comments on the dataset is contained in my DS7003 coursework which is located at: https://github.com/ericchchiu/u1720146_DS7004_courseworkCodeAndData
